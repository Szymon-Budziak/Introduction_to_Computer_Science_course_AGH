# WDI_exercises_solutions
This is the repository with solutions from WDI (WstÄ™p do Informatyki - Introduction to Computer Science) exercises at AGH. Here I will share all of the codes written by me.
All codes are written in English and according to the PEP 8 style.

## Licence
If you use this repository/code for classes or for something else, please give me a star or a fork :). It will help me know that my work is important and useful to someone.
